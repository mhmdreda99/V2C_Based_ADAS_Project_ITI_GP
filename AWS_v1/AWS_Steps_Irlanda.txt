In server Irelanda
Thing name --> RaspberryPi_gp
Rule name --> RaspberryPi_Rule
Dynamodb Table --> V2c_Table_v4
Lambda Functoion --> RaspberryPiFunc

#Our GP is running from this server

1-Creat AWS thing --> This step is done and details below:-
			1-Create a thing from AWS core
			2-Generate Certificate - private key - public key - CA root
			3-Create a policy
			4-Attach Generated certificate to the thing and policy
			5-Wrtie a code and connect by MQTT through this cridentials
			By this way we already generated a thing and we can send and receive data through a broker.
			But this data is not stored so to store this data we need database -> Next step we need to create Dynamodb
			
 -- To create this dynamodb we need a lambda function, This func triggered by the thing and invoke data into dynamodb
 So we need to make a Lambda Rule 
 
 2-Create Lambda rule --> This step is done and details below :-
 			  1-Enter Rules and create a new rule and give it a name
 			  2-write SQL statment --> In this u write what rule will take from the broker
 			  3-Choose action --> In our case action is Lambda func
 			  4-create a new Lambda Func , in this func:-
 			  				1-Choose run time language
 			  				2-Make IAM Role to this Lambda func. to give access mangment to this Lambda by:-
 			  				2-1- Create an IAM Role for Lambda:"Select type of trusted entity" section, select "AWS service," and in the "Use case" section, choose "Lambda."
 			  				2-2-Attach Policy Permissions:1-AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess policy:- to give Lambda function access to DynamoDB, 
 			  							      2-AWSIoTDataAccess policy:-to make Lmabda interact with IOT core,This policy allows the Lambda function to publish and receive messages from IoT Core.
                          5-After creating it go back to our RUle in IOT and choose created Lambda 
                          6-create rule.
                          8-Go back to Lambda and write code for the trigger -IOT thing- :-
                          import boto3
---------------------------------------------
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('dynamodb')
    response = client.put_item(
        TableName = 'raspiData_v2',
        Item = {
            'Temperature':{'N': str(event['Temperature'])},
            'FuelLevel':{'N': str(event['FuelLevel'])},
            'Elapsedtime':{'N': str(event['Elapsedtime'])},
            'BSA_state': {'S': event['BSA_state']}
        }
    )
    return 0
___________________________________________________________                   
-- By these steps we already Created -> A thing - A rule for this thing which is Lambda - a Lambda function

3- Create Dynamodb Table--> This step is done and details below:-
			  1-Create a table and give it a name and choose partition key and sort key 
			  2-Attach table name to Lambda function 
			  
-- By these steps we Created a Database in AWS cloud and this database is NoSQL and you can send and receive data to this table through your thing.
---> Next Step:-
Import data from Dynamodb table and make a dash board.
