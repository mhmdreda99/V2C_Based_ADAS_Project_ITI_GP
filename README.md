## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with Raspbian OS
- [STM32 IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Version X.X or higher)


### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mhmdreda99/V2C_Based_ADAS_Project_ITI_GP.git
    ```

2. Open the STM32 IDE and load the STM32 project from the `STM32` directory.

3. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Follow the specific setup steps for your project components.

### To-Do

Before running the project, make sure to complete the following to-do items:

- Configure the Raspberry Pi with necessary dependencies.
- Connect and configure the STM32 board.
- Any additional project-specific steps.

### Running the Project

Follow the instructions in your STM32 IDE documentation to build and upload the firmware to the STM32 board.

For Raspberry Pi components, execute the necessary Python scripts or commands.
