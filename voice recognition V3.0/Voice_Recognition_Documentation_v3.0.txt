Voice Recognition System with Raspberry Pi 3B+
----------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
This document outlines the implementation of a voice recognition system using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. 
The system allows you to control various components, such as an engine, AC motor, wiper, and audio playback, by recognizing specific voice commands.
----------------------------------------------

2. Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- DC Motors for engine and AC control
- Servo motor for wiper control
- Microphone
- Audio playback device
- Power supply for motors
----------------------------------------------

3. Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS or any compatible Linux distribution
- Python 3.x
- RPi.GPIO library
- speech_recognition library
- gpiozero library
- VLC media player
- Internet connection for speech recognition
----------------------------------------------

4. Setup and Wiring
1. Raspberry Pi Setup:
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running the Raspbian OS (or any compatible Linux distribution) and is connected to the internet.
- Update your Raspberry Pi's operating system and install the required libraries.

2. Wiring Diagram:
Below is a general guide for connecting common components:

Engine (DC Motor):
- Connect the positive (red) wire to a 5V power source.
- Connect the negative (black) wire to the ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect one terminal (in1 or in2) to one GPIO pin (e.g., 17) for motor control and the other terminal (in1 or in2) to another GPIO pin (e.g., 27).
- AC Motor (DC Motor, similar to engine):

- Connect the positive (red) wire to a 5V power source.
- Connect the negative (black) wire to the ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect one terminal (in3 or in4) to one GPIO pin (e.g., 5) for motor control and the other terminal (in3 or in4) to another GPIO pin (e.g., 6).

Servo Motor (Wiper):
- Connect the servo's signal wire to a GPIO pin (e.g., 18).
- Connect the servo's positive (red) wire to a 5V power source.
- Connect the servo's negative (black) wire to the ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi.

Microphone:
- Connect the microphone to the Raspberry Pi's USB port.
- Audio Playback Device (Speakers):

3. Run the Python Script:
- Upload the Python script provided earlier (or your own script) to your Raspberry Pi.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing your script.

4. Voice Commands:
The system is now ready to accept voice commands. Use the following commands to control various functions:
"start engine"
"stop engine"
"open AC"
"stop AC"
"turn on wiper"
"play audio"
"stop audio"
"exit"
The system will respond to your voice commands by controlling the connected hardware components.

5. Code Explanation

The Python code provided in the project serves as the core of the voice recognition system. It initializes GPIO pins, controls motors, servo, and audio playback through voice commands. Below are the key components of the code:

- GPIO Setup: The code initializes the GPIO pins for controlling the motors and servo.
- Motor Control: It uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control the motors' speed and direction.
- Servo Control: A servo motor controls the wiper. It swings back and forth in response to voice commands.
- Audio Playback: The code utilizes VLC to play audio files.
- Speech Recognition: It uses the speech_recognition library to capture voice commands and respond accordingly.
- Main Loop: The main loop listens for audio input, recognizes the speech, and executes the corresponding action based on the recognized commands.
----------------------------------------------

6. Usage
- Power up the Raspberry Pi and ensure that all the hardware components are connected as per the wiring diagram.
- Run the Python script on the Raspberry Pi.
- The system is now ready to accept voice commands. Use commands like "start engine," "stop engine," "open AC," "stop AC," "turn on wiper," "play audio," "stop audio," and "exit" to control various functions.
- The system will respond to your voice commands by controlling the connected hardware components.
----------------------------------------------

7. Troubleshooting
Internet Connection for Speech Recognition:
- If you are using a cloud-based speech recognition service, ensure that your Raspberry Pi has an active internet connection. The speech recognition engine may not work without it.
- server can't recognize the voice
----------------------------------------------
