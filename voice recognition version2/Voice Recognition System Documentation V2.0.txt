Power Supply: The system is powered by a 5V/2A power adapter connected to
the Raspberry Pi's micro USB port. Ensure a stable power supply to avoid
system instability.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Software Setup
Operating System: The Raspberry Pi runs Raspbian OS. Detailed
instructions on downloading, installing, and configuring the OS are
available on the Raspberry Pi Foundation's official website.
Programming Languages and Tools:
1- Python for Raspberry Pi
2- C for STM32F401CC
Voice Recognition AlgorithmVoice Recognition Algorithm: The system employs a combination of keyword
spotting and machine learning-based speech recognition. It uses a pretrained neural network model to detect specific keywords and phrases.
Code Implementation
Code Structure: The project's code is organized into three main
components: Raspberry Pi application, STM32F401CC firmware, and a voice
recognition library. Each component handles specific tasks.
Code Walkthrough: In the Raspberry Pi application, the code captures
audio input, processes it, and sends recognized commands to the
STM32F401CC. The STM32F401CC firmware interfaces with peripherals and
executes commands
-------------------------------------------------------------
Testing
Testing Procedure: To test the system, connect the hardware as described,
record voice commands, and verify that the system correctly identifies
and executes the commands. A list of sample commands and expected
outcomes is provided in the documentation.
